This repository was created to accommodate the Capstone (Taniland) project model in the Wake 2023 Machine Learning Path program, which is a land management application aimed at the agricultural industry so that it can assist in better land management through the features we have made in this application.


To make a plant recommendation feature we create a model through temperature, humidity and image data according to land conditions, in making this feature we use 3 algorithms to build a planting recommendation model:
* by IoT
   * Clustering : Kmeans
   * Classification : Decission Tree
* by Image
   * Deep Learning : CNN
